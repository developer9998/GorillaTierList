# GorillaTierList
GorillaTierList is a mod that adds a tierlist to the game.    
Video Tutorial: https://youtu.be/AQ-w3VG_lYA

## Format 
The tierlist is customizeable with a file in your Plugins folder after you open your game with the mod. The first line is the title, and everything after is the options you can drag onto the tierlist. For instance, below this text is the default tierlist.   
**NOTE: The title has a maximum character count of 22, and the option has a maximum character count of 61.**
```
Title

```

For images, you need to add a PNG image in the same folder with the text file with the name of the option. For instance, here is a table of options and then the image name so you get a good idea of what to set your image names.    
**NOTE: Images only work with the PNG image extention.**
| Option Name  | Image Name      | Would it work? |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| Option       | Option.png      | Yes            |
| DevIsSilly   | DevIsSilly.png  | Yes            |
| DevIsntSilly | devisntsilly.png| No             |
| IAmSo Silly  | IAmSo Silly.png | Yes            |

If you're doing a cosmetic tierlist or an option for a tierlist that is a cosmetic, there is a built in feature that sets the image to that cosmetic name if it can't find an image of that cosmetic in your files. This only works if there is brackets around the option and the option is a valid cosmetic name registered by Gorilla Tag. This does not need you to require the perfect capitalization, it can be lowercase or uppercase and it would still work. For instance here is a table of option names as well as if the image would be automatically set, we're using the ``TURKEY LEG`` as an example.     
**NOTE: Some of the valid cosmetic names Gorilla Tag has are weird such as the headphone's being ``HEADPHONES1`` and such.**
| Option Name  | Would it work? |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| (Turkey Leg) | Yes            |
| (TURKEY LEG) | Yes            |
| Turkey Leg   | No             |
| (Turkey Log) | No             |
